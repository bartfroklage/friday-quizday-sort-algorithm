# Friday quiz dat sort algorithm

## What is this?
This project contains an empty function and a spec file. Your goal is to make the unit test pass.
It should really solve the problem, so don't put the expected output in the return statement, you should really write a sort algorithm.

The first to create a pull request that adds a passing test wins a beer.
The person creating the most efficient algorithm also wins a beer.

This quiz is open for pull request until **Friday 15 April at 15:30. The winner will be announced at 16:00**.

## How to use npm and grunt?

To make the test run:
* make sure you have Grunt installed.
```npm install -g grunt```
* install all the dependencies
```npm instsall```
* create a specrunner
```grunt jasmine:nocover:build```
* and/or run the test from the command line (this will also create a coverage report)
```grunt```

## How do you measure which algorithm is most efficient?
In order to determine which algorithm is most efficient I will look at the line coverage count. The lowest count wins.
